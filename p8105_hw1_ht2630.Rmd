This is homework 1. 

___

```{r}
# Problem 1

library(moderndive)

data("early_january_weather")

?early_january_weather

weather = early_january_weather

colnames(weather)

ncol(weather)

nrow(weather)

temp = weather$temp

mean(temp)

library(tidyverse)

time_hour = weather$time_hour

ggplot(weather, 
       aes(x = time_hour, y = temp, color = 'red')) + 
  geom_point() +
  xlab("Date and Time") + 
  ylab("Temperature")

ggsave("p8105_hw1_ht2630_ggplot.jpg")
```

We can see there are 15 columns and 358 rows. The variables are shown in the first result. 

According to the section of "Help",

"temp" is the temperature. 

"dewp" is the dew point. 

"wind_dir", "wind_speed", and "wind_gust" are wind derection, speed and gust speed. 

"precip" is the precipitation. 

"visib" is the visibility. 

"time_hour" is the data and hour of recording. 

The last section shows the mean temperature is 39.58212. 

The ggplot shows that temperature has some fluctuation across the time but a increasing trend is observed.
